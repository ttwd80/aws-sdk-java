 * AWS Transfer for SFTP is a fully managed service that enables the transfer of files directly into and out of Amazon
 * S3 using the Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)—also known as Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol. AWS helps
 * you seamlessly migrate your file transfer workflows to AWS Transfer for SFTP—by integrating with existing
 * authentication systems, and providing DNS routing with Amazon Route 53—so nothing changes for your customers and
 * partners, or their applications. With your data in S3, you can use it with AWS services for processing, analytics,
 * machine learning, and archiving. Getting started with AWS Transfer for SFTP (AWS SFTP) is easy; there is no
 * infrastructure to buy and setup.
